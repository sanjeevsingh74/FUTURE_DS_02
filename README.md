# Customer Support Ticket Analysis
## 📍 Project Objective
The primary objective of this analysis was to assess the performance of the customer support team by evaluating service request patterns, resolution efficiency, and customer satisfaction, with the goal of identifying key improvement areas to enhance overall service quality and customer experience.

## Executive Summary:
Customer Support Ticket Analysis evaluates service trends, customer demographics, issue types, and performance metrics such as First Response Time and Resolution Time to identify areas for improvement and enhance customer satisfaction.
## ✅ Key Insights:

**Ticket Type Distribution**

A significant volume of support tickets are related to technical issues and billing inquiries, indicating critical touchpoints in the customer journey.

Minimal volume for general inquiries suggests that basic information might be accessible, yet technical challenges remain unresolved without assistance.



**Response & Resolution Performance:**

Some tickets are missing resolution times, indicating potential service backlog or unresolved queries.

First response times vary, with some tickets receiving delayed responses beyond industry best practice (within 1 hour).

**Customer Satisfaction Ratings:**

Satisfaction ratings, where available, show a direct correlation with faster resolution times.

Lower satisfaction scores were commonly linked to prolonged ticket handling or incomplete support interaction.

Satisfaction ratings range from 1 to 5, but many entries are missing ratings.

Lower ratings (1–2) correlate with longer resolution times or tickets unresolved.

**Customer Demographics:**

Majority of customers are aged between 25–45 years.

Gender distribution is skewed slightly towards female customers.

The customer base is diverse, showing usage across various tech and software products.

**Peak Support Hours:**

Most tickets are raised during weekday business hours, with spikes between 10 AM to 4 PM.

This indicates optimal staffing should be concentrated during these hours.

## 📌 Recommendations to Maximize Service & Improve Customer Satisfaction
